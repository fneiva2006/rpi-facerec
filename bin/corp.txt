my name is Bonnie and I was born in San Antonio and the story I'm going to tell is about my mother
a little background first
Her see her mothers family were wealthy people at one time
They owned car dealerships and extensive land
I don't know if they were farmers or not but I know they were land owners
many acres and her grandmother was raised in wealth
then the Depression came and apparently everyone lost all their money
she was raised in and she married a man this is my grandmother I'm talking about
And they were very poor by this point and they had I think seven children
And one particular Christmas things were very very difficult
There was no money to buy any presents at all for the children and my grandfather
who was killed when my mother was
this was of course way before that he must have been a very positive person because what he did with the 
situation was he he told the children that there were no presents this Christmas because they had given 
them all to Santa to take the poor children and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves 
it gave them a good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves
I felt like that was a way to face that situation with such hope and with joy and with love
although I never met my grandfather I have never forgotten that story and when I hear of him I think what a wonderful
wonderful person he must have been
And how long have you lived in Charlotte
I have lived in Charlotte for a year
I lived in Charlotte for five years
We came here in
we lived here for five years then we moved for seven years and now we have been back one year
